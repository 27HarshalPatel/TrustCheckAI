TrustCheckAI is an end-to-end bias and compliance auditing, explainability, and model-monitoring platform designed to evaluate bias, mitigate discrimination, explain model decisions, and continuously monitor deployed machine learning systems using Prometheus & Grafana.

It provides real-time dashboards, fairness metrics, model explainability (LIME), drift detection, automated PDF reporting, and user feedback collection — all wrapped in a modern Streamlit UI and containerized for seamless deployment.

## 🧩 Protected Attribute

In TrustCheckAI, the **protected attribute** is a sensitive feature such as **race, gender, age, or ethnicity** that represents groups we want to **protect from unfair treatment**.

Why it is important:

- 📏 **Fairness metrics are defined with respect to protected groups.**  
  Measures like Statistical Parity Difference, Disparate Impact, and Equal Opportunity compare outcomes between protected and non‑protected groups. Without a protected attribute, these metrics cannot be computed.

- 🧪 **Bias detection requires group-wise comparison.**  
  By conditioning on the protected attribute, TrustCheckAI can reveal whether the model treats one group systematically worse than another (e.g., lower approval rates or higher false-positive rates).

- 🛡 **Used for auditing, not for discrimination.**  
  In a responsible workflow, the protected attribute is often **excluded from the model features used for prediction**, but **retained in the evaluation pipeline** so that fairness can be audited post‑hoc.

- 📜 **Regulatory and ethical compliance.**  
  Many regulations (EEOC, GDPR “special categories”, anti‑discrimination laws) explicitly refer to protected characteristics. Correctly identifying and handling the protected attribute is essential for demonstrating compliance.

TrustCheckAI makes the protected attribute explicit in the UI and in the generated reports so that stakeholders clearly understand **which groups are being evaluated for fairness** and how mitigation affects them.
